## USER'S CURRENT MOOD & PREFERENCES

**Desired feeling:** ${MOOD_DESCRIPTIONS[preferences.mood]}

**Time commitment:** ${TIME_DESCRIPTIONS[preferences.time]}

## THEIR BACKLOG (${eligibleGames.length} eligible games)

${gamesListFormatted}

## USER'S GAMING HISTORY (Important - use this to personalize your recommendation!)

${finishedGames.length > 0 ? `**Games they FINISHED** (they loved these enough to complete - similar games are likely safe picks): ${finishedGames.slice(0, 10).join(', ')}${finishedGames.length > 10 ? ` and ${finishedGames.length - 10} more` : ''}` : 'No finished games yet.'}

${droppedGames.length > 0 ? `**Games they DROPPED** (lost interest - be cautious with similar styles/genres): ${droppedGames.slice(0, 10).join(', ')}${droppedGames.length > 10 ? ` and ${droppedGames.length - 10} more` : ''}` : 'No dropped games.'}

**Playtime patterns in backlog:** Look at the "Already played" values - games with some playtime mean they've tried it and might want to continue. Games with 0 playtime are completely fresh.

## YOUR TASK

Pick ONE game from the backlog that best matches the current mood, energy, and time preferences. Consider:
- **Their history matters**: If they finished similar games before, that's a strong signal. If they dropped similar games, be cautious.
- **Playtime signals interest**: Games they've already started playing might be good to continue. Fresh games (0 playtime) are also great for new experiences.
- Games that were skipped/rerolled before should generally be deprioritized (but not excluded)
- Higher-rated games are generally safer picks
- Match the time commitment (roguelikes work for "short" sessions even if total playtime is long)
- Match the mood/genre appropriately

IMPORTANT: Write the reasoning in second person, speaking directly to the user (use "you/your", not "the user/their"). Reference their history when relevant (e.g., "Since you finished X, you might enjoy this similar game...").
${
  previousReasonings.length > 0
    ? `
AVOID REPETITION: The user has rerolled. Here are your previous suggestions - do NOT repeat the same reasoning patterns or reference the same games from their history:
${previousReasonings.map((r, i) => `${i + 1}. "${r}"`).join('\n')}

Use DIFFERENT examples from their history and vary your reasoning style.`
